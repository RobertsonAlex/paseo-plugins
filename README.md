# paseo-plugins

Trusted local [Paseo](https://paseo.sh) plugins for watching agents, searching past chats,
linking tasks, and opening a remote editor. Each directory is its own plugin and installs
independently.

These plugins use the 0.8 plugin SDK. They need **Paseo 0.8 or a current nightly**. Plugins are
trusted, unsandboxed code: the server entry can read files and run commands on the daemon machine,
and the client entry runs inside the Paseo app.

## Install

```bash
paseo plugin add panrafal/paseo-plugins:<plugin>
```

From a checkout on the daemon machine:

```bash
paseo plugin install /absolute/path/to/paseo-plugins/<plugin>
```

Then `paseo plugin ls` should show `running`. After source edits: `npm run typecheck` and
`paseo plugin reload <plugin>`.

## Plugins

### Agents dash

[`agents-dash-list`](./agents-dash-list) — a sidebar list of workspaces grouped by what needs you:
waiting, unread, in progress, failing, approved, idle, merged or closed. Archive or mark unread
from the row.

![Agents dash](./agents-dash-list/images/agents-dash-list.png)

No settings screen. Open **Agents dash** in the sidebar or Command Center. It lists every workspace
on the selected host.

### Agents history

[`agents-history`](./agents-history) — every workspace and agent the daemon has ever had, including
archived ones. Filter by archived state, provider, project, label, and period. Ranked search
indexes on-disk transcripts (names and paths first); regex mode greps instead.

![Agents history](./agents-history/images/agents-history.png)

No settings screen. Filters live on the surface. The index is stored under
`$PASEO_HOME/plugin-data`. Opening an archived agent asks for confirmation before restoring it.

### Schedule runs

[`schedule-runs`](./schedule-runs) — one feed of every schedule run: status, workspace, agent,
archived state, and the agent's final response. Filter by schedule, status, archived state, and
keyword.

![Schedule runs](./schedule-runs/images/schedule-runs.png)

No settings screen. Reads schedule records on disk; it does not create, pause, or delete
schedules.

### Session usage

[`session-usage`](./session-usage) — token, cache, cost, and activity stats for Claude, Codex,
OpenCode, Kilo, and Devin CLI from local transcripts and session stores, including archived
sessions and subagents, plus Cursor activity without token counts. Sortable table, provider charts,
calendar, and CSV export. Subscription allowance cards show Paseo's reported limits with per-hour or
per-day token charts that focus the report, and how long each allowance lasts at the current pace.
Parsed usage is kept in an index, so reopening only reads changed sources.

![Session usage](./session-usage/images/session-usage.png)

No settings screen. Filter the report by provider, project, workspace, and date on the surface.
Reads local files only.

### Agent heartbeats

[`agent-heartbeats`](./agent-heartbeats) — a composer pill with the heartbeat count. Press it for a
panel that lists, creates, edits, and deletes that agent's heartbeats. Schedules accept cron, delays
such as `15m`, and phrases such as `every 15 minutes`.

![Heartbeat pill](./agent-heartbeats/images/agent-heartbeats-pill.png)
![Heartbeats panel](./agent-heartbeats/images/agent-heartbeats-panel.png)

No settings screen. The pill is per agent; the panel is an agent tab.

### Skills usage

[`skills-usage`](./skills-usage) — a composer **Skills** pill with the count of skills the agent has
loaded in this chat. Press it for a searchable popover: skills used in this chat on top, then every
skill the session reports, with a **Used** badge and an icon for where the skill lives (user,
project, project-local, plugin, built-in). Pressing a skill puts `/skill-name` into the message
input.

No settings screen. Reads the provider's command list, the agent timeline, and the skill
directories on the daemon machine. On phones the mention is copied to the clipboard instead of
inserted.

### Task link

[`task-link`](./task-link) — a composer pill when the agent's branch, title, or workspace name
matches a regular expression. Press the pill to open the configured HTTP(S) link.

![Task link settings](./task-link/images/task-link-settings.png)

Configure under **Settings → Plugins → task-link → Task link**, or **Configure task link** in the
Command Center:

- **Task regular expression** — JavaScript pattern without `/` delimiters. The first non-empty
  capture group is the ID.
- **Task link** — HTTP(S) URL containing `{ID}`.

The shipped default matches `CT-1234` style IDs and opens Notion. Change both to match your tracker
before using the pill. Settings are stored under `$PASEO_HOME/plugin-data/task-link/settings.json`.

### Remote editor

[`vscode-open-remote`](./vscode-open-remote) — a composer **Editor** pill that opens the agent's
working directory in VS Code, Cursor, or a custom URI. Hidden on phones; tablets open vscode.dev
through a tunnel named after the Paseo host.

![Editor pill](./vscode-open-remote/images/vscode-open-remote-pill.png)
![Remote editor settings](./vscode-open-remote/images/vscode-open-remote-settings.png)

Configure under **Settings → Plugins → vscode-open-remote → Remote editor**, or **Configure remote
editor** in the Command Center. Settings live under
`$PASEO_HOME/plugin-data/vscode-open-remote/settings.json`.

### Chat resume

[`chat-resume`](./chat-resume) — pills on agents that stopped without finishing: continue now if
the allowance has already renewed, schedule one resume after renewal, or prepare an editable
handover to Claude, Codex, Cursor, or another ready provider **in the same workspace**. An agent
that went idle mid-turn — a daemon restart, a provider exit — gets a plain **Continue** instead.

No settings screen, and no screenshot here: the pills appear when the latest idle or error
state is a usage-limit / quota exhaustion or an unfinished turn, including when you reopen the
thread later. The
handover draft is an agent panel; the new agent does not start until **Start agent** is pressed.

### Profile routing

[`profile-routing`](./profile-routing) — a provider whose agent is a router. Each message runs a
model script from plugin settings (with `EFFORT` from the thinking option), starts that agent in
the same workspace, and either relays its answer or lets it run after the router finishes
(`handoff` / `detach`).

Configure models, relay timeout, and handoff archive delay under **Settings → Plugins →
profile-routing**. `handoff` and `detach` need `archiveOnFinish: false` on schedules so the
delegate is not archived with the run workspace.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run typecheck
```

Each plugin has its own README for behavior, storage paths, and reload steps. `AGENTS.md` is the
agent-facing guide; `CLAUDE.md` points at it.
