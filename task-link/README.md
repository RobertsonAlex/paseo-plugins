# task-link

Adds a composer pill when an agent's branch, title, or workspace name contains a task ID.
Press the pill to open the configured link. Configure several links to get one pill per link
that matches. Previously named `capitally-tasks`.

## Settings

Open **Settings → Plugins → task-link → Task link**, or choose **Configure task link** in the
Command Center. Each link has its own pattern, link, and optional label; **Add** appends a link
and **Remove** deletes one. With no links, no pills appear. Requires a Paseo client with `addSettingsScreen`, `openSettings`, and
`@getpaseo/plugin/client/ui` support. Paseo owns settings navigation, scrolling, mobile layout, and theme.

- **Task regular expression**: a JavaScript pattern without `/` delimiters or flags. Matching is
  case-sensitive; use character classes such as `[Cc][Tt]` to accept either case. For each match,
  the first non-empty capture group, in group order, is the task ID. If there are no capture groups,
  the whole match is used. Matches with only empty/unmatched groups are skipped.
- **Task link**: an HTTP(S) URL containing `{ID}`. Every `{ID}` is replaced with the URL-encoded
  captured text. Case and punctuation in the ID are preserved.
- **Pill label** (optional): text shown on the pill instead of the task ID, such as `PR` or
  `Notion {ID}`. Every `{ID}` is replaced with the raw captured text. Leave empty to show the ID.
- **Preview**: try a branch or title to inspect each link's pill text and destination before saving.

| Pattern | Input | Task ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `\b(CT-\d+)\b` | `feature/CT-1234-fix` | `CT-1234` |
| `(\[CT-\d+\])|-(ct-\d+)` | `Fix [CT-1234]` | `[CT-1234]` |
| `(\[CT-\d+\])|-(ct-\d+)` | `feature-ct-42` | `ct-42` |
| `CT-(\d+)` | `CT-1234` | `1234` |

For example, `https://tracker.example/tasks/{ID}` opens task `CT-1234` at
`https://tracker.example/tasks/CT-1234`. A bracketed ID becomes `%5BCT-1234%5D`.

The default is one link that matches `\b([Cc][Tt]-\d+)\b` and opens `https://www.notion.so/{ID}`. Unlike the old plugin,
IDs are no longer forced to uppercase.

Settings use validated plugin RPCs and are saved atomically under
`$PASEO_HOME/plugin-data/task-link/settings.json` (default Paseo home: `~/.paseo`). They are shared
by clients of that daemon and survive plugin reloads. A `settings.json` from earlier versions,
holding a single `pattern` and `urlTemplate`, loads as one link and is rewritten as
`{ "links": [...] }` on the next save. Up to 20 links are allowed. Saving updates this client's pills immediately;
other clients refresh within 15 seconds and also read the latest settings before opening a link.

## How it works

Sources are checked in this order: branch, agent title, workspace title, workspace name.
Within each source, matches are checked from left to right. Each link resolves its task
independently, and pills appear in the order of the links.

- `shared/link.ts` extracts task IDs and builds links; `shared/settings.ts` validates settings.
- `server/branch.ts` reads the checked-out branch with `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`.
- `client/pill.tsx` follows agent/workspace updates and refreshes branches after agent turns.
- Pills disappear when no task matches or the agent is archived, and are removed on disconnect
  or plugin reload along with subscriptions and the settings refresh timer.

## Limitations

- The shipped default matches `CT-1234` style IDs and opens Notion. Change the pattern and URL
  in settings before relying on the pill.
- The native settings screen needs a Paseo client with `addSettingsScreen`, `openSettings`, and
  `@getpaseo/plugin/client/ui` support.

## Install

```bash
paseo plugin add panrafal/paseo-plugins:task-link
```

From a checkout:

```bash
npm install            # from the monorepo root
npm run typecheck
paseo plugin install /absolute/path/to/paseo-plugins/task-link
paseo plugin ls        # expect "running"
```

When replacing an installed `capitally-tasks`, remove that old installation and install `task-link`
from its renamed directory to avoid duplicate pills. The old plugin had no saved settings.

After editing:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm test --workspace=task-link
paseo plugin reload task-link
paseo plugin logs task-link
```
