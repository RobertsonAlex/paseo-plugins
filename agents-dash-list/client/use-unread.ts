/**
 * The plugin's own "mark as unread" flags, kept by the server entry of the host the dash was
 * opened on. That one store covers every host the dash shows — workspace ids are UUIDs, so the
 * flat namespace holds — and the query is keyed by `hostId` because a different host means a
 * different server entry and therefore a different store.
 *
 * `activeWorkspaceIds` only tells the server which marks may be pruned, so it is read from a ref
 * at fetch time rather than folded into the query key: the workspace directory changes constantly
 * and every change would otherwise drop the cache and refetch.
